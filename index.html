<!-- 
  System Overview:

  1. Recruiters can view all candidates for a relevant position (see page/all.Candidates.html).
  2. Each candidate's card shows their profile picture (from third-party or uploaded by user), bio, location, and links to their resume (CV) and LinkedIn if available.
  3. Users (candidates) can upload their profile picture and resume (CV) via their profile page.
  4. Uploaded files are handled by the backend via the uploadFile utility (see js/pagesJs/profile/uploadFile.js).
  5. Candidate data, including links to uploaded files, is fetched and rendered for recruiters.

  Main Flow:
    - Candidate uploads profile picture and CV on their profile page.
    - Data is saved and associated with their user profile.
    - Recruiter visits the "All Candidates" page for a position.
    - The system fetches and displays all candidates for that position, including their profile picture and CV link.

  Key Files:
    - js/pagesJs/profile/uploadFile.js: Handles file uploads.
    - js/pagesJs/profile/profileLoad.js: Loads and displays user profile, including uploaded files.
    - js/cards/candidateCard.js: Renders candidate cards with profile picture, bio, CV, and LinkedIn.
    - js/pagesJs/candidate/listCandidates.js: Fetches and renders all candidates for a job.
    - page/all.Candidates.html: UI for recruiters to view all candidates for a position.

  Security:
    - Only recruiters can access the "All Candidates" page.
    - File uploads are validated and stored securely on the server.

  User Experience:
    - Candidates see their uploaded profile picture and CV on their profile.
    - Recruiters see all relevant candidate info, including third-party profile pictures and resumes, in one place.
